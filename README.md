Here is a iteration of my version of project "Around the U.S." https://zip-file.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/ thank you for viewing !

**Video Explanation**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
